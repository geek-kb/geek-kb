## Itai Ganot
DevOps Engineer | Kubernetes | Cloud Infrastructure | Security

I build secure, scalable, and production-grade cloud-native platforms.  
My focus is infrastructure architecture, Kubernetes platform engineering, GitOps workflows, and security-first system design.

I work at the intersection of reliability, automation, and security — designing systems that are maintainable, observable, and resilient under real production conditions.

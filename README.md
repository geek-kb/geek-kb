## Itai Ganot
Principal DevOps Engineer | Cloud-Native Architecture | Kubernetes Security

I design and lead the implementation of secure, scalable cloud-native platforms.

My work focuses on platform architecture, Kubernetes security strategy, GitOps operating models, and infrastructure design across multi-environment and multi-account cloud systems.

I operate at the intersection of architecture, automation, and security — building platforms that enable teams to move fast without compromising reliability or control.


### Architecture & Technical Leadership

Platform Engineering  
Designing internal platforms that standardize infrastructure patterns, enforce security baselines, and reduce cognitive load for development teams.

Cloud Architecture  
Multi-account AWS design, environment isolation, IAM boundary modeling, secure networking, and production-grade deployment workflows.

Kubernetes & GitOps  
Cluster architecture, workload security boundaries, admission control strategies, and declarative delivery using ArgoCD and Helm.

Infrastructure as Code  
Terraform, Terragrunt, Crossplane — building reusable, composable infrastructure modules aligned with organizational standards.

Security Engineering  
Kubernetes hardening, RBAC design, network segmentation, mTLS, CIS alignment, and DevSecOps integration within CI/CD pipelines.
